# üè• Medical Department Classifier

**Natural Language Processing | Healthcare AI | Transformers**

This project builds a robust NLP pipeline to classify medical questions into 20+ departments such as **Neurology**, **Cardiology**, **Oncology**, and more ‚Äî leveraging domain-specific models and healthcare datasets.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Using the **MedQuAD** dataset (a collection of medical question-answer pairs), this project processes and classifies medical questions into their respective departments.

Key components of the pipeline:

-  **XML Parsing** of QA pairs from the MedQuAD dataset.
-  **Text Preprocessing** using **SciSpaCy**:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Lemmatization
  - Stopword removal
-  **Vectorization** using TF-IDF
-  **Multi-class Classification** using **BioBERT** (fine-tuned via Hugging Face Transformers)
-  **Label Encoding** and performance evaluation with classification reports and visualizations
